This Java program implements a simple console-based PhoneBook application.
It uses a `HashMap` to store contacts with name as the unique key.
Users can add or update contacts with optional phone and email information.
Contacts can be retrieved by exact name or searched using a partial name.
All contacts can be listed in alphabetical order by name.
A command-line menu guides user interaction until they choose to exit.
